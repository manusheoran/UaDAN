    Apply transforms to box, segmentation and keypoints annotations of a single instance.

    It will use `transforms.apply_box` for the box, and
    `transforms.apply_coords` for segmentation polygons & keypoints.
    If you need anything more specially designed for each data structure,
    you'll need to implement your own version of this function or the transforms.

    Args:
        annotation (dict): dict of instance annotations for a single instance.
            It will be modified in-place.

            the same input dict with fields "bbox", "segmentation", "keypoints"
            transformed according to `transforms`.
